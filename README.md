I am a self-motivated, out of the box Full Stack Software Engineer with excellent communication skills. I've spent the last 7 years working in music production as a Sound Engineer. The bulk of that has been working at Abbey Road Studios. Already being technically minded I decided to dive into the world of coding head first! I get the same creative buzz writing code (creating, refactoring) as I do writing and producing music (creating, editing). I learn fast and
strive to have new challenges thrown at me.

# Skills

Technical

#### Logical Thinker
Due to my previous roles being technical ones, I was constantly having to solve problems then determine the most effective way to tackle them in future.

#### Strong Communication Skills
As a sound engineer, I was constantly working with others,  having strong communication skills was vital. Daily I dealt with external clients directly, often working to tight deadlines so an elevated level of communication and prioritisation is critical. More recently at Makers Academy, I was constantly pair-programming and working in teams using Agile concepts.  

#### Creative
I've always loved writing music and have spent a lot of time working on
