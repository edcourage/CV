I am a self-motivated, out of the box Full Stack Software Engineer with excellent communication skills. I've spent the last 7 years working in music production as a Sound Engineer. The bulk of that has been working at Abbey Road Studios. Already being technically minded I decided to dive into the world of coding head first! I get the same creative buzz writing code (creating, refactoring) as I do writing and producing music (creating, editing). I learn fast and
strive to have new challenges thrown at me.

# Skills

#### Logical Thinker
Due to my role at the studios being a technical one, I was constantly having to solve problems then determine the most effective way to tacle them in future.

#### Strong Communication Skills
As a sound engineer, I was constantly working with others,  having strong communication skills was vital to understanding what the client wanted and then delivering. More recently at Makers Academy, I was constantly pair-programming and working in teams using Agile concepts.  

#### Creative Thinker




# Experience

#### Transfer Engineer, Abbey Road Studios (_March 2014 - Sep. 2019_)

I was part of the Post Production team at the Studios. My responsibilities range from transferring/restoring world-renowned original masters to Mastering and Editing on high profile commercial releases. Im constantly having to maintain and deliver the highest possible standard and that’s ingrained into everyone who's worked at the studios. It's an extremely varied and dynamic work environment, juggling many different projects at once. Daily I dealt with external clients directly, often working to tight deadlines so an elevated level of communication and prioritisation is critical.


#### Abbey Road (Live Here Now) - Internship (_Nov. 2012 - Feb. 2013_)

I was primarily working on the Boyzone BZ20 Tour and the Wet Wet Wet Greatest Hits Tour. Leading up to both tours I was tasked with organising logistics (booking the hotels etc..) as well as recruiting sound engineering students to assist on the multiple show dates. I was on the road overseeing the merchandising and looking after the students. I would also help the recording engineers when they needed assistance.

#### Freelance sound engineering work (_June 2013 - present_)
