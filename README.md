## Background

I am a self-motivated, out of the box Software Engineer with excellent communication skills. I've spent the last 7 years working in music production. The bulk of that has been working at Abbey Road Studios. Already being tecnically minded I decided to dive into the world of coding head first! More and more I got the same creative buzz writing code (creating, refactoring) as I did writing and producing music (creating, editing). I learn fast and
strive to have new challenges thrown at me.

## Experience

#### Transfer Engineer, Abbey Road Studios (_March 2014 - Sep. 2019_)

I was part of the Post Production team at the Studios. My responsibilities range from transferring/restoring world-renowned original masters to Mastering and Editing on high profile commercial releases. Im constantly having to maintain and deliver the highest possible standard and that’s ingrained into everyone who's worked at the studios. It's an extremely varied and dynamic work environment, juggling many different projects at once. Daily I dealt with external clients directly, often working to tight deadlines so an elevated level of communication and prioritisation is critical.

#### Abbey Road (Live Here Now) - Internship (_Nov. 2012 - Feb. 2013_)

I was primarily working on the Boyzone BZ20 Tour and the Wet Wet Wet Greatest Hits Tour. Leading up to both tours I was tasked with organising logistics (booking the hotels etc..) as well as recruiting sound engineering students to assist on the multiple show dates. I was on the road overseeing the merchandising and looking after the students. I would also help the recording engineers when they needed assistance.
