I am a self-motivated, out of the box Full Stack Software Engineer with excellent communication skills. I've spent the last 7 years working in music production as a Sound Engineer. The bulk of that has been working at Abbey Road Studios. Already being technically minded I decided to dive into the world of coding head first! I get the same creative buzz writing code (creating, refactoring) as I do writing and producing music (creating, editing). I learn fast and
strive to have new challenges thrown at me.

## Skills



**People** <br>
As a sound engineer, I was usually working with others. A lot of the clients weren't technical and/or didn't always know precisely what they wanted.  I'd have to work with and guide the client to get the desired result.

**Creative** <br>
In music, I'm always looking for something different. May it be writing my material or working on artists. I like to take a step back to find inspiration, experiment with new ideas until bang! This approach is the same when developing software, whether solving a problem or thinking of a new feature.

**Fast Learner** <br>
At Makers when we switched from Ruby to Javascript, I picked up the language very fast. I found I already knew the concepts so everything else was a short google away. This has been the case with other technologies. For our final project, we decided to use the React framework, Next.js. Although it was new, I could again relate to the concepts and quickly start to see its advantages.

**inquisitive** <br>
I always want to visualise what my codes doing. It's not good enough something just working, I want to know how/why it's working, can I improve it.

**Team Player** <br>
I'm at my best working with others. At Makers, we're either pairing or working in teams using Agile concepts. I'm always very clear about what I'm working on and enjoy working with others to solve complex problems.
