#Ed Courage

I am a self-motivated, out of the box thinker with excellent communication skills. I learn fast and
strive to have new challenges thrown at me. I work well in, and have lots of experience under pressure situations to achieve deadlines at all 
costs.

Why coding?

I want to create things, I want to play god....
You can build pretty much anything.... virtually. Create worlds, objects, solze problems.

turning point?

Needing something new... discovering coding and realising it was completely different to what I imagined.

previous job was becoming very Niche.

Volentiering at gigs

##Team player
I worked as part of the Post Production team at Abbey Road Studios for over 5 years constantly working with colleagues and clients to overcome challenges and complete projects.

##Experience

Transfer Engineer, Abbey Road Studios.

March 2014 - September 2019

I was part of the Post Production team at the Studios. My responsibilities range from transferring/restoring world-renowned original masters to Mastering and Editing on high profile commercial releases. Im constantly having to maintain and deliver the highest possible standard and that’s ingrained into everyone who's worked at the studios. It's an extremely varied and dynamic work environment, juggling many different projects at once. Daily I dealt with external clients directly, often working to tight deadlines so an elevated level of communication and prioritisation is critical.

November 2012 - February 2013

I was primarily working on the Boyzone BZ20 Tour and the Wet Wet Wet Greatest Hits Tour. Leading up to both tours I was tasked with organising logistics (booking the hotels etc..) as well as recruiting sound engineering students to assist on the multiple show dates. I was on the road overseeing the merchandising and looking after the students. I would also help the recording engineers when they needed assistance.
