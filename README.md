I am a self-motivated, out of the box Full Stack Software Engineer with excellent
communication skills. Having spent the last seven years working in music production as a
Sound Engineer, I decided to retrain as a Software Engineer to follow my passion for
coding. I find I get the same creative buzz writing code as I do when creating and
producing music, connecting people with useful data in an intuitive way. My previous
training and interest in photography enable me to adapt and question existing structures
to design new apps and webpages that are appealing and easy to use.

## Skills





**Creative** <br>
In music, I'm always looking for something different, whether it be composing my material or working on artists. I like to take a step back to find inspiration, experiment with new ideas until bang! This approach is the same when developing software, whether solving a problem or thinking of a new feature. A recent example is my Quizzical app. I had the problem of how to notify the user whether they got the answer to the question correct... I took a step back and found inspiration! Time to add some DOM JavaScript. Now when the user selects an answer, the button will change colour to either red or green, depending on the resultâ€”letting the user know if they got the question correct.

**Fast Learner** <br>
At Makers when we switched from Ruby to Javascript, I picked up the language very fast. I found I already knew the concepts so everything else was a short google away. This has been the case with other technologies. For our final project, we decided to use the React framework, Next.js. Although it was new, I could again relate to the concepts and quickly start to see its advantages.

**Inquisitive** <br>
I always want to visualise what my code is doing. It's not good enough something just working; I want to know how/why it's working, can I improve it. When first experimenting API calls in the form of JS Promise's, I got the result using the 'then' function. It worked, but how?... After some reading and a little experimentation, I realised what was happening. A promises state will change from pending to either fulfilled or refected. If the state changes to fulfilled, it will run the 'then' function and whatever you give it as an argument. If rejected, the promise will attempt and run the catch function and whatever you give it as an argument.

**Team Player** <br>
I'm at my best working with others. At Makers, we're either pairing or working in teams using Agile concepts. I'm always very clear about what I'm working on and enjoy working with others to solve complex problems. When working on our final project (a pub crawl app), we were trying to implement a feature that allowed the user to share a google maps route using just the URL. As a group, we decided to save the object needed to generate the route to a MongoDB database. I thought the best way to solve this would be for the group of four to split into two. The first pair worked on saving the new object to the database, the second on retrieving the stored object from the database. We implemented the new feature in a short time due to excellent teamwork and communication.
